## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

``` {r}

library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)

```
Alt-dash creates <-

class() gives you the class of an object.

as_tibble(df) converts to a tibble.

str() DOES NOT convert to a string. It shows what an object contains.


```{r plot, echo=TRUE}
library(gapminder)
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

```

aes stands for aesthetic mappings.
Plot is called a geom in ggplot.

geom_point: scatterplots
geom_bar: barplots
geom_boxplot: boxplots

``` {r}
library(gapminder)
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point(color='yellow') + geom_smooth(method=lm) + scale_x_log10()

```
alpha = transparency
size = size
shape = shape
method -for fitting lines

```{r labels}

p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, mapping=aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))
p + geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method="gam") + 
  scale_x_log10(labels= scales::dollar) +
  labs(x = "GDP per Capita", y = "life expectancy in years", 
       title = "Growth and Life Expectancy", 
       subtitle= "Data points are country-years",
       caption = "Source: Gapminder")


```
